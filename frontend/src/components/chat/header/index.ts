/**
 * Chat Header Components
 * 
 * Modular header components following SOLID principles:
 * - Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear purpose
 * - Open/Closed: Easy to extend with new features
 * - Interface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces
 * - Dependency Inversion: Components depend on props/abstractions
